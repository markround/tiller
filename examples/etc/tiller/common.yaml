# Example configuration file, demonstrating how to use Tiller.
#
# These examples create two templates with different values depending on if you set the environment to
# "production" or "staging".
#
# This would be called with the following environment variables set (e.g. from a bash prompt) :
#
# tiller_base=$PWD/examples/etc/tiller tiller_lib=$PWD/examples/lib tiller
#
# (Tiller uses the "production" environment if none is set). Or, for staging:
#
# environment=staging tiller_base=$PWD/examples/etc/tiller tiller_lib=$PWD/examples/lib tiller
#
# See the documentation for more details on how to use this in a Dockerfile.

# exec: The executable to handover to after execution. In a Dockerfile, this would probably be /usr/bin/supervisord
# Or some other daemon. For testing, /usr/bin/date (or similar) is a useful one-shot command that just exits,
# so you can inspect your templates.
exec: date

# data_sources: Sources of data. Here, we're pulling in the provided FileDataSource (ships with this gem), and also the
# NetworkDataSource under examples/lib/tiller. This is found because we set tiller_lib when we called the tiller
# executable. We're not pulling in the example DummyDataSource, because it also provides target_values, so would
# overwrite the target_values from FileDataSource - you should only have one DataSource providing this information,
# otherwise your templates may end up in strange places you didn't expect!
data_sources:
  - file
  - network


# template_sources: Sources of templates, in priority order (first takes precendence). Again using the provided
# FileTemplateSource (uses templates under <tiller_base>/templates), and also because we set tiller_lib, we can use
# DummyTemplateSource which creates a single "dummy.erb" template.
template_sources:
  - file
  - dummy
