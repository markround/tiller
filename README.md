# What is it?

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/markround/tiller](https://badges.gitter.im/markround/tiller.svg)](https://gitter.im/markround/tiller?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)
Tiller is a tool that generates configuration files. It takes a set of templates, fills them in with values from a variety of sources (such as environment variables, YAML files, JSON from a webservice...), installs them in a specified location and then optionally spawns a child process.

You might find this particularly useful if you're using Docker, as you can ship a set of configuration files for different environments inside one container, and easily build "parameterized containers" which users can then configure at runtime. 

However, its use is not just limited to Docker; you may also find it useful as a sort of "proxy" that can provide values to application configuration files from a data source that the application does not natively support. 

It's available as a [Ruby Gem](http://https://rubygems.org/gems/tiller), so installation should be a simple `gem install tiller`.

## Quickstart
A simple tutorial which produces a 'parameterized' NginX container with Tiller is on my blog : [http://www.markround.com/blog/2014/09/18/tiller-and-docker-environment-variables/](http://www.markround.com/blog/2014/09/18/tiller-and-docker-environment-variables/). It also provides a downloadable archive of the files used in the example, so if you want to get up and running very quickly before diving into the rest of the documentation, then this is probably the best place to start.

## More information
You may find a lot of the flexibility that Tiller offers overwhelming at first. I have written a few blog tutorials that provide a good overview of what Tiller can do, with practical examples; I strongly recommend that if you're new to all this, you read the following articles through for an introduction :

# Background
I had a number of Docker containers that I wanted to run with a slightly different configuration, depending on the environment I was launching them. For example, a web application might connect to a different database in a staging environment, a MongoDB replica set name might be different, or I might want to allocate a different amount of memory to a Java process. This meant my options basically looked like:

* Maintain multiple containers / Dockerfiles.
* Maintain the configuration in separate data volumes and use --volumes-from to pull the relevant container in.
* Bundle the configuration files into one container, and manually specify the `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` values to pick this up. 

None of those really appealed due to duplication, or the complexity of an approach that would necessitate really long `docker run` commands. 

So I knocked up a quick Ruby script (originally called "Runner.rb") that I could use across all my containers, which does the following :

* Generates configuration files from ERB templates (which can come from a number of sources)
* Uses values provided from a data source (i.e YAML files) for each environment
* Copies the generated templates to the correct location and specifies permissions
* Optionally executes a child process once it's finished (e.g. mongod, nginx, supervisord, etc.)
* Now provides a pluggable architecture, so you can define additional data or template sources. For example, you can create a DataSource that looks up values from an LDAP store, or a TemplateSource that pulls things from a database. 

This way I can keep all my configuration together in the container, and just tell Docker which environment to use when I start it. I can also use it to dynamically alter configuration at runtime ("parameterized containers").

## Why "Tiller" ?
Docker-related projects all seem to have shipyard-related names, and this was the first ship-building related term I could find that didn't have an existing gem or project named after it! And a tiller is the thing that steers a boat, so it sounded appropriate for something that generates configuration files.


# Usage
Tiller can be used to dynamically generate configuration files before passing execution over to a daemon process. 

It looks at an environment variable called "environment" (or the argument to the `-e` flag), and creates a set of configuration files based on templates, and then optionally runs a specified daemon process via `exec`. Usually, when running a container that uses Tiller, all you need to do is pass the environment to it, e.g. 

	# docker run -t -i -e environment=staging markround/demo_container:latest
	tiller v0.3.1 (https://github.com/markround/tiller) <github@markround.com>
	Using configuration from /etc/tiller
	Using plugins from /usr/local/lib/tiller
	Using environment staging
	Template sources loaded [FileTemplateSource]
	Data sources loaded [FileDataSource, NetworkDataSource]
	Templates to build ["mongodb.erb", "sensu_client.erb"]
	Building template mongodb.erb
	Setting ownership/permissions on /etc/mongodb.conf
	Building template sensu_client.erb
	Setting ownership/permissions on /etc/sensu/conf.d/client.json
	Template generation completed
	Executing /usr/bin/supervisord
	Child process forked.

If no environment is specified, it will default to using "development". Prior to version 0.4.0, this used to be "production", but as was quite rightly pointed out, this is a bit scary. You can always change the default anyway - see below. 

## A word about configuration
Tiller uses YAML for configuration files. If you're unfamiliar with YAML, don't worry - it's very easy to pick up. A good introduction is here : ["Complete idiot's introduction to YAML"](https://github.com/Animosity/CraftIRC/wiki/Complete-idiot's-introduction-to-yaml)

Prior to Tiller v0.7, configuration was spread out over several files. If you had 3 environments (e.g. dev, stage and prod), you'd have a `common.yaml` for main configuration, one yaml file for each of your environments (`dev.yaml`,`stage.yaml` and so on), and possibly more depending on which plugins you'd enabled (`defaults.yaml` etc.)

However, 0.7 and later versions allow you to place most configuration inside a single `common.yaml` file, which can make things a lot clearer - you have a single place to view your configuration at once. I have therefore updated the documentation to cover this new style as the preferred approach. See [this blog post](http://www.markround.com/blog/2015/09/07/tiller-0-dot-7-0-and-simpler-configuration-files/) for an example.

Of course, you can always use the old "one file for each environment" approach if you prefer. Tiller is 100% backwards compatible with the old approach, and I have no intention of removing support for it as it's very useful in certain circumstances. The only thing to be aware of is that you can't mix the two configuration styles: If you configure some environments in `common.yaml`, Tiller will ignore any separate environment configuration files.

	    

## Arguments
Tiller understands the following *optional* command-line arguments (mostly used for debugging purposes) :

* `-n` / `--no-exec` : Do not execute a child process (e.g. you only want to generate the templates)
* `-v` / `--verbose` : Display verbose output, useful for debugging and for seeing what templates are being parsed
* `-d` / `--debug` : Enable additional debug output
* `-b` / `--base-dir` : Specify the tiller_base directory for configuration files
* `-l` / `--lib-dir` : Specify the tiller_lib directory for user-provided plugins
* `-e` / `--environment` : Specify the tiller environment. This is usually set by the 'environment' environment variable, but this may be useful for debugging/switching between environments on the command line.
* `-a` / `--api` : Enable the HTTP API (See below)
* `-p` / `--api-port` : Set the port the API listens on (Default: 6275)
* `-x` / `--exec` : Specify an alternate command to execute, overriding the exec: parameter from your config files
* `-h` / `--help` : Show a short help screen

# Setup
All of the following assumes you're using Tiller with Docker. So, firstly install the Tiller gem and set your Dockerfile to use it (assuming you're pulling in a suitable version of Ruby already) :

```dockerfile
RUN gem install tiller
...
... Rest of Dockerfile here
...
CMD ["/usr/local/bin/tiller" , "-v"]
```

Now, set up your configuration. By default, Tiller looks for configuration under `/etc/tiller`, but this can be set to somewhere else by setting the environment variable `tiller_base` or by using the `-b` flag. This is particularly useful for testing purposes, e.g.

	$ tiller_base=/tmp/tiller tiller -v
	
or

	$ tiller -v -b /tmp/tiller

Tiller expects a directory structure like this (using /etc/tiller as its base, and the file data and template sources) :

	etc
	└── tiller
	    ├── common.yaml
	    │
	    └── templates
	        ├── sensu_client.erb
	        ├── mongodb.erb
	        ...
	        ... other configuration file templates go here
	        ...

It is suggested that you add all this under your Docker definition in a `data/tiller` base directory (e.g. data/tiller/common.yaml, data/tiller/templates and so on...) and then add it in your Dockerfile. This would therefore now look like:
```dockerfile
RUN gem install tiller
...
... Rest of Dockerfile here
...
ADD data/tiller /etc/tiller
CMD ["/usr/local/bin/tiller" , "-v"]
```

Note that the configuration directory was added later on in the Dockerfile; this is because `ADD` commands cause the Docker build cache to become invalidated so it's a good idea to put them as far as possible towards the end of the Dockerfile.

## Common configuration

### Complete example
I'll cover each part of this in detail, but to give you an idea of where we're going with this, here's the complete configuration file I discuss in the examples below :

```yaml
exec: [ "/usr/bin/mongod" , "--config" , "/etc/mongodb.conf" , "--rest" ]
data_sources: [ 'file' , 'environment' ]
template_sources: [ 'file' ]
environments:

	staging:

		mongodb.erb:
  			target: /etc/mongodb.conf
  			user: root
  			group: root
  			perms: 0644
			config:
				replSet: 'staging'

	production:
	
		mongodb.erb:
  			target: /etc/mongodb.conf
 			config:
    			replSet: 'production'
    			
	development:

		mongodb.erb:
  			target: /etc/mongodb.conf
```
Note that instead of the YAML one-per-line list format for enabling plugins, I used the shorthand array format ( `[ 'item1' , 'item2', .....]` ).

I'll now cover each section and parameter in the following paragraphs.

### Main configuration values

`common.yaml` contains most of the configuration for Tiller. It contains top-level `exec`, `data_sources`, `template_sources` and `default_environment` parameters, along with sections for each environment. 

It can also take optional blocks of configuration for some plugins (for example, the [HTTP Plugins](README-HTTP.md)). Settings defined here can also be overridden on a per-environment basis (see [below](#overriding-common-settings))

* `exec`: This is simply what will be executed after the configuration files have been generated. If you omit this (or use the `-n` / `--no-exec` arguments) then no child process will be executed. As of 0.5.1, you can also specify the command and arguments as an array, e.g.

```yaml
	exec: [ "/usr/bin/supervisord" , "-n" ]
```

This means that a shell will not be spawned to run the command, and no shell expansion will take place. This is the preferred form, as it means that signals should propagate properly through to spawned processes. However, you can still use the old style string parameter, e.g.

```yaml
	exec: "/usr/bin/supervisord -n"
```

* `data_sources` : The data sources you'll be using to populate the configuration files. This should usually just be set to "file" and "environment" to start with, although you can write your own plugins and pull them in (more on that later).
* `template_sources` Where the templates come from, again a list of plugins.
* `default_environment` : Sets the default environment file to load if none is specified (either using the -e flag, or via the `environment` environment variable). This defaults to 'development', but you may want to set this to 'production' to mimic the old, pre-0.4.0 behaviour.

So for a simple use-case where you're just generating everything from files or environment variables and then spawning MongoDB, you'd have a common.yaml with this at the top:
```yaml
exec: [ "/usr/bin/mongod" , "--config" , "/etc/mongodb.conf" , "--rest" ]
data_sources:
	- file
	- environment
template_sources:
	- file
```

### Ordering
Since Tiller 0.3.0, the order you specify these plugins in is important. They'll be used in the order you specify, so you can order them to your particular use case. For example, you may want to retrieve values from the `defaults` data source, then overwrite that with some values from the `file` data source, and finally allow users to set their own values from the `environment_json` source (see below for more on each of these). In which case, you'd specify :
```yaml
data_sources:
  - defaults
  - file
  - environment_json
```

Note also that template-specific values take priority over global values (see the Gotchas section for an example).

## Template files

These files under `/etc/tiller/templates` are simply the ERB templates for your configuration files, and are populated with values from the selected environment configuration blocks (see below). When the environment configuration is parsed (see below), key:value pairs are made available to the template. 

**IMPORTANT: **These files must be named with a suffix of `.erb`. Any files without an ending of `.erb` will be ignored.

Here's a practical example, again using MongoDB. Let's assume that you're setting up a "MongoDB" container for your platform to use, and you want to have it configured so it can run in 3 environments: 

* A local "development" environment (e.g. your own laptop), where you don't want to use it in a replica set.
* "staging" and "production" environments, both of which are setup to be in a replica set, named after the environment.

MongoDB needs to have the replica set name specified in the configuration file when it's launched. You'd therefore create a template `templates/mongodb.erb` template with some placeholder values:

```erb
... (rest of content snipped) ...
	
# in replica set configuration, specify the name of the replica set
<% if (replSet) %>
replSet = <%= replSet %>
<% end %> 
	
... (rest of content snipped) ...
```

Now it will only contain the `replSet = (whatever)` line when there is a variable "`replSet`" defined. How that gets defined is (usually) the job of the environment configuration blocks - these are covered next.

## Environment configuration

These headings in `common.yaml` (underneath the `environments:` key) are named after the environment variable `environment` that you pass in (usually by using `docker run -e environment=<whatever>`, which sets the environment variable). Alternatively, you can set the environment by using the `tiller -e` flag from the command line. 

When you're using the default `FileDataSource`, these environment blocks in `common.yaml` define the templates to be parsed, where the generated configuration file should be installed, ownership and permission information, and also a set of key:value pairs that are made available to the template via the usual `<%= key %>` ERB syntax.

Carrying on with the MongoDB example, here's how you might set the replica set name in your staging and production environments (add the following to `common.yaml`):

```yaml
environments:

	staging:

		mongodb.erb:
  			target: /etc/mongodb.conf
  			user: root
  			group: root
  			perms: 0644
			config:
				replSet: 'staging'

	production:
	
		mongodb.erb:
  			target: /etc/mongodb.conf
 			config:
    			replSet: 'production'
```

Note that if you omit the user/group/perms parameters - as shown above for the production environment - the defaults are whatever Docker runs as (usually root). Also, if you don't run Tiller as root, it will skip setting these.

The development environment definition can be even simpler, as we don't actually define a replica set, so we can skip the whole `config` block :

```yaml
	development:

		mongodb.erb:
  			target: /etc/mongodb.conf
```

So now, when run through Tiller/Docker with `-e environment=staging`, the template will be installed to /etc/mongodb.conf with the following content :

	# in replica set configuration, specify the name of the replica set
	replSet = staging
	
Or, if the production environment is specified :

	# in replica set configuration, specify the name of the replica set
	replSet = production

And if the `development` environment is used (it's the default, so will also get used if no environment is specified), then the config file will get installed but with the line relating to replica set name left out.

Of course, this means you need an environment block for each replica set you plan on deploying. If you have many Mongo clusters you wish to deploy, you'll probably want to specify the replica set name dynamically, perhaps at the time you launch the container. You can do this in many different ways, for example by using the `environment` plugin to populate values from environment variables (`docker run -e repl_set_name=foo ...`) and so on. These plugins are covered in the next section.


### Overriding common settings
As of Tiller 0.5.0, you can also override defaults from common.yaml if you specify them in a `common` block in an environment section. This means you can specify a different `exec`, enable the API, or configure various plugins to use different settings on a per-environment basis, e.g.

```yaml
environments:

	development:
		
		# Only enable API for development environment, and
		# also specify HTTP plugin values	
		common:
		  api_enable: true
		  api_port: 1234
		  
		  # configuration for HTTP plugin (https://github.com/markround/tiller/blob/master/README-HTTP.md)
		  http:
		    uri: 'http://tiller.dev.example.com'
		    ...
		    ...
		    ... rest of config file snipped
		    ...
		    ...
```


## Separate configuration files per environment

Instead of placing all your environment configuration in `common.yaml`, you can split things out into separate files. This was the default behaviour of Tiller < 0.7.0, and will remain supported. To do this, create a `environments` directory, and then a yaml file named after your environment. 

For example, if you had a `common.yaml` that looked like the [example above](#complete-example), you would create a `environments/staging.yaml` file with the following content:

```yaml
mongodb.erb:
	target: /etc/mongodb.conf
	user: root
	group: root
	perms: 0644
	config:
		replSet: 'staging'
```
And so on, one for each environment. You would then remove the `environments:` block from `common.yaml`, and Tiller will switch to loading these individual files.


## Plugins

In addition to specifying values in the environment files, there are other plugins that can also provide values to be used in your templates, and you can easily write your own. The plugins that ship with Tiller are :

### File plugins
These provide data from YAML environment files, and templates from ERB files (see above).

### HTTP plugins
These allow you to retrieve your templates and values from a HTTP server. Full documentation for this plugin is available in [README-HTTP.md](README-HTTP.md)

### ZooKeeper plugins
These allow you to store your templates and values in a [ZooKeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org) cluster. Full documentation for this plugin is available in [README-zookeeper.md](README-zookeeper.md)

### Defaults plugin
If you add `  - defaults` to your list of data sources in `common.yaml`, you'll be able to make use of default values for your templates, which can save a lot of repeated definitions if you have a lot of common values shared between environments. You can also (as of Tiller 0.7.3) use it to install a template across all environments.

These defaults are sourced from a `defaults:` block in your `common.yaml`, or from `/etc/tiller/defaults.yaml` if you are using the old-style configuration. For both styles, any individual `.yaml` files under `/etc/tiller/defaults.d/` are also loaded and parsed. 

Top-level configuration keys are `global` for values available to all templates, and a template name for values only available to that specific template. For example, in your `common.yaml` you could add something like:

```yaml
data_sources: [ 'defaults' , 'file' , 'environment' ]
defaults:

	global:
  		domain_name: 'example.com'
	  
	application.properties.erb:
	    target: /etc/application.properties
	    config:
  		    java_version: 'jdk8'
```

This would make the variable `domain_name` availabale to all templates, and would also ensure that the `application.properties.erb` template gets installed across all environments.

### Environment plugin
If you activated the `EnvironmentDataSource` (as shown by adding `  - environment` to the list of data sources in the example `common.yaml` above), you'll also be able to access environment variables within your templates. These are all converted to lower-case, and prefixed with `env_`. So for example, if you had the environment variable `LOGNAME` set, you could reference this in your template with `<%= env_logname %>`

### Environment JSON
If you add `  - environment_json` to your list of data sources in `common.yaml`, you'll be able to make complex JSON data structures available to your templates. Just pass your JSON in the environment variable `tiller_json`. See [http://www.markround.com/blog/2014/10/17/building-dynamic-docker-images-with-json-and-tiller-0-dot-1-4/](http://www.markround.com/blog/2014/10/17/building-dynamic-docker-images-with-json-and-tiller-0-dot-1-4/) for some practical examples.

As of Tiller 0.7.6, you can use this to also handle per-template variables, instead of treating everything as a "global" variable. To do this, make sure you have a key `_version` with a value of `2`. You can then separate values into global and per-template blocks, for example :

```json
{
  "_version" : 2,
  "global" : {
    "global_value" : "This is a global value available to all templates"
  },
  "template.erb" : {
    "local_value" : "This will create the 'local_value' only on template.erb"
  }
}
```

### Random plugin
If you add `  - random` to your list of data sources in `common.yaml`, you'll be able to use randomly-generated values and strings in your templates, e.g. `<%= random_uuid %>`. This may be useful for generating random UUIDs, server IDs and so on. An example hash with demonstration values is as follows : 

	{"random_base64"=>"nubFDEz2MWlIiJKUOQ+Ttw==",
	 "random_hex"=>"550de401ef69d92b250ce379e5a5957c",
	 "random_bytes"=>"3\xC8fS\x11`\\W\x00IF\x95\x9F8.\xA7",
	 "random_number_10"=>8,
	 "random_number_100"=>71,
	 "random_number_1000"=>154,
	 "random_urlsafe_base64"=>"MU9UP8lEOVA3Nsb0OURkrw",
	 "random_uuid"=>"147acac8-7229-44af-80c1-246cf08910f5"}

### XML File plugin
This plugin parses the contents of an XML file (for example, a Maven POM) and makes the resulting structure available to your templates. First, run `gem install crack` to make sure you have the [crack gem](https://github.com/jnunemaker/crack) installed for XML parsing. 

You can then enable this plugin by adding `xml_file` to your list of datasources in `common.yaml`. Once this has been done, you can specify two further parameters; either at the top-level of `common.yaml`, or per-template. These parameters are :

* `xml_file_path` : Path to the XML file
* `xml_file_var` : Variable name that your templates will use to access the structure.

For example, assuming the following XML is loaded from a file specified in `xml_file_path` :

```xml
<project>
        <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
        <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>
        <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
        <version>1</version>
</project>
```

If you set `xml_file_var: maven_pom`, you would then be able to reference elements in your templates like so :

```erb
ArtifactID: <%= maven_pom['project']['artifactId'] %>
```

See the [test fixtures](https://github.com/markround/tiller/tree/master/features/fixtures/xml_file) and corresponding [test scenario](https://github.com/markround/tiller/blob/master/features/xml_file.feature) under the features/ directory for full examples.

# API
There is a HTTP API provided for debugging purposes. This may be useful if you want a way of extracting and examining the configuration from a running container. Note that this is a *very* simple implementation, and should never be exposed to the internet or untrusted networks. Consider it as a tool to help debug configuration issues, and nothing more. Also see the "Gotchas" section if you experience any `Encoding::UndefinedConversionError` exceptions.

## Enabling
You can enable the API by passing the `--api` (and optional `--api-port`) command-line arguments. Alternatively, you can also set these in `common.yaml` :
	
```yaml
api_enable: true
api_port: 6275
```

## Usage
Once Tiller has forked a child process (specified by the `exec` parameter), you will see a message on stdout informing you the API is starting :

	Tiller API starting on port 6275
	
If you want to expose this port from inside a Docker container, you will need to add this port to your list of mappings (e.g. `docker run ... -p 6275:6275 ...`). You should now be able to connect to this via HTTP, e.g.

```
$ curl -D - http://docker-container-ip:6275/ping
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Server: Tiller 0.3.1 / API v1

{ "ping": "Tiller API v1 OK" }

```

## Methods
The API responds to the following GET requests:

* **/ping** : Used to check the API is up and running.
* **/v1/config** : Return a hash of the Tiller configuration.
* **/v1/globals** : Return a hash of global values from all data sources.
* **/v1/templates** : Return a list of generated templates.
* **/v1/template/{template_name}** : Return a hash of merged values and target values for the named template.


# Developer information
If you want to build your own plugins, or generally hack on Tiller, see [DEVELOPERS.md](DEVELOPERS.md)

# Gotchas
## Merging values
Tiller will merge values from all sources. It will warn you, but it won't stop you from doing this, which may have undefined results. Particularly if you include two data sources that each provide target values - you may find that your templates end up getting installed in locations you didn't expect, or containing spurious values!

## Empty config
If you are using the file datasource with Tiller < 0.2.5, you must provide a config hash, even if it's empty (e.g. you are using other data sources to provide all the values for your templates). For example:

```yaml
my_template.erb:
  target: /tmp/template.txt
  config: {}
```

Otherwise, you'll probably see an error message along the lines of :

```
/var/lib/gems/1.9.1/gems/tiller-0.2.4/bin/tiller:149:in `merge!': can't convert nil into Hash (TypeError)
```

After 0.2.5, you can leave the config hash out altogether if you are providing all your values from another data source (or don't want to provide any values at all).

## ERb newlines
By default, ERb will insert a newline character after a closing `%>` tag. You may not want this, particularly with loop constructs. As of version 0.1.5, you can suppress the newline using a closing tag prefixed with a `-` character, e.g. 

```erb
<% things.each do |thing| -%>
	<%= thing %>
<% end -%>
```
You may also need tell your editor to use Unix-style line endings. For example, in VIM :

	:set fileformat=unix

## API Encoding::UndefinedConversionError exceptions
This seems to crop up mostly on Ruby 1.9 installations, and happens when converting ASCII-8BIT strings to UTF-8. A workaround is to install the 'Oj' gem, and Tiller will use this if it's found. I didn't make it a hard dependency of Tiller as Oj is a C-library native extension, so you'll need a bunch of extra packages which you may consider overkill on a Docker container. E.g. on Ubuntu, you'll need `ruby-dev`, `make`, a compiler and so on. But if you have all the dependencies, a simple `gem install oj` in your Dockerfile or environment should be all you need.

## Signal handling
Not a "gotcha" as such, but worth noting. Since version 0.4.0, Tiller catches the `INT`,`TERM` and `HUP` signals and passes them on to the child process spawned through `exec`. This helps avoid the ["PID 1"](http://blog.phusion.nl/2015/01/20/docker-and-the-pid-1-zombie-reaping-problem/) problem by making sure that if Tiller is killed then the child process should also exit.

## Global and template-specific value precedence 
A "global" value will be over-written by a template-specific value (e.g. a value specified for a template in a `config:` block). This may cause you unexpected behaviour when you attempt to use a value from a data source such as `environment_json` or `environment` which exposes its values as global values.

For example, if you have the following in an environment configuration block :

```yaml
my_template.erb:
  target: /tmp/template.txt
  config:
    test: 'This is a default value'
```

And then use the environment_json plugin to try and over-ride this value, like so :

`$ tiller_json='{ "test" : "From JSON!" }' tiller -n -v ......`

You'll find that you won't see the "From JSON!" string appear in your template, no matter what order you load the plugins. This is because the `test` value in your environment configuration is a local, per-template value and thus will always take priority over a global value.

If this isn't what you want, for the `environment_json` plugin, you can use the new v2 JSON format (as described above) to split your values into global and per-template local values. 

Another solution is to provide a default, but allow it to be over-ridden, by using the `defaults` plugin to provide the default values (so all global data sources are merged in the correct order).
